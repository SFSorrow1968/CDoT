Bleed Damage Over Time (DOT) brings realistic bleeding mechanics to Blade & Sorcery. When you wound an enemy, they will continue taking damage over time based on where you hit them.

Key features:
- Location-based damage: Different body parts have different bleed severity. A slash to the throat causes rapid blood loss while a cut on the arm is much less severe.
- Configurable zones: Throat, Head, Neck, Torso, Arms, Legs, and Dismemberment each have their own damage multiplier, duration, and tick damage.
- Stacking wounds: Multiple hits to the same zone can stack (up to configurable limits), increasing bleed severity.
- Dismemberment bleeding: Severing limbs causes massive, sustained blood loss.

Zone damage multipliers (default):
- Throat: 3.0x - Critical strikes cause rapid blood loss
- Neck: 2.5x - Major vessel damage
- Head: 2.0x - Significant trauma
- Dismemberment: 2.5x - Massive blood loss from severed limbs
- Torso: 1.0x - Baseline damage
- Leg: 0.6x - Slower peripheral bleeding
- Arm: 0.5x - Minor peripheral wounds

The system is designed to add tactical depth to combat - targeting vital areas rewards precision while allowing enemies to survive minor wounds. All settings are fully configurable through the in-game mod options menu.

Supports both PCVR and Nomad builds.
