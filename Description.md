## Detailed Description (<=50,000 chars)
⚠️ TRIGGER WARNING: This mod contains realistic blood and gore effects including bleeding, dismemberment, and wound mechanics. Not suitable for those sensitive to graphic violence.

Bleed Damage Over Time (DOT) brings realistic bleeding mechanics to Blade & Sorcery. When you wound an enemy, they will continue taking damage over time based on where you hit them.

Key features:
- Location-based damage: Different body parts have different bleed severity. A slash to the throat causes rapid blood loss while a cut on the arm is much less severe.
- Configurable zones: Throat, Head, Neck, Torso, Arms, Legs, and Dismemberment each have their own damage multiplier, duration, and tick damage.
- Stacking wounds: Multiple hits to the same zone can stack (up to configurable limits), increasing bleed severity.
- Dismemberment bleeding: Severing limbs causes massive, sustained blood loss.

Zone damage multipliers (default):
- Throat: 3.0x - Critical strikes cause rapid blood loss
- Neck: 2.5x - Major vessel damage
- Head: 2.0x - Significant trauma
- Dismemberment: 2.5x - Massive blood loss from severed limbs
- Torso: 1.0x - Baseline damage
- Leg: 0.6x - Slower peripheral bleeding
- Arm: 0.5x - Minor peripheral wounds

The system is designed to add tactical depth to combat - targeting vital areas rewards precision while allowing enemies to survive minor wounds. All settings are fully configurable through the in-game mod options menu.

Supports both PCVR and Nomad builds.
